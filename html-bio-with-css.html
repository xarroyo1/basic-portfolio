          Hello, my name is Xyra (zy-ruh).
          <br>
          <br>
          First of all, I have to say that I'm Mexican, because apparently I look anything but Mexican to those who first see me. So I have to put it out there.

            I am a recent graduate from Georgia State University in the Spring of 2019 with a Bachelors degree in Psychology. I am currently working full-time at Eagles Landing Christian Counseling Center as an Assistant while gaining experience and connections to further pursue my aspiration of becoming a Psychologist or Counselor in the future, along with doing other part-time work. For volunteer work, I volunteer as a trained Crisis Text Counselor on the side helping those in difficult situations.

            While in college, I quickly noticed my deep interest in coding and I want to learn everything there is about web development. I then applied and got accepted into the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp. While in my journey to becoming a Psychologist, I want to work for a company in front-end (or back-end) web development where I can implement both my psychological and coding skills towards websites based on client interest and behavior. By learning the person or people, I can then draw out conclusions to what information on the website engages clientele the most. I would then use that information to create better, more appealing content for a more interesting and simplistic user-interface. While becoming a crazed psychological web developer, I will also want to create my own Environmental awareness non-profit/website that has current data and news regarding drastic environmental events in America and around the world.
            <br>
            <br>
            To break it all down, I have a passion for coding, the environment, and aiding the minds of others.
